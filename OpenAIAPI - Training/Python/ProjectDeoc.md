# python -m venv myenv

```
python -m venv myenv
```

**`venv`** : This is the module you're asking Python to run using the `-m` option. The `venv` module is Python's built-in module for creating virtual environments. A virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.

## What Happens When You Run the Command

When you execute `python -m venv myenv`, the following occurs:

* A directory named `myenv` is created in your current working directory. This directory will serve as the root of the virtual environment.
* Within the `myenv` directory, a subdirectory named `Lib` (on Windows) or `lib` (on Unix/macOS) is created to store installed Python packages. The exact structure can vary slightly between operating systems.
* A script directory (`Scripts` on Windows and `bin` on Unix/macOS) is also created that contains the Python and `pip` executable files. These executables are configured to use the packages installed in the virtual environment, rather than system-wide packages.
* The virtual environment is configured so that when you activate it, any Python or pip commands will use the versions contained within the virtual environment instead of the global Python installation. This allows you to manage dependencies for your project independently of other projects.
